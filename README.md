# Ichikosai-Auto-Retweeting
Ichikosai (the school festival of Ibaraki Prefectural Tsuchiura First High School, Japan) twitter account needs to retweet each committees' tweet automatically.

## Notice
I don't know how to continuously catch new tweets, so I use Heroku Scheduler temporarily. I think this program costs nothing.

## Prerequisites
- Installation of gem "twitter"

```
gem i twitter
```

## This program uses:
- Heroku
- Heroku Addon (Advanced Scheduler)
